# Real-Time Incident Reporting & Response Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Incident Reporting & Response Platform** is a citizen-driven web application designed to enable fast, accurate, and location-based incident reporting. The platform helps authorities and administrators monitor, verify, and respond to incidents efficiently using real-time data.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Current emergency reporting systems suffer from:

* Delayed incident reporting
* Lack of real-time location and time data
* No centralized monitoring dashboard
* Inefficient manual communication

These issues lead to slower emergency responses and increased risks to public safety.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A **real-time web-based incident reporting system** that:

* Allows citizens to instantly report incidents
* Automatically captures **GPS location** 
* Displays incidents on a **live admin and user dashboard**
* Helps responders prioritize and coordinate actions effectively

**Goal:** Faster reporting → Faster response → Safer communities

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **React.js** – Component-based UI development
* React Hooks – State and lifecycle management
* CSS / UI libraries – Styling and responsiveness

### Backend

* **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime
* **Express.js** – REST API framework
* **Mongoose** – MongoDB object modeling

### Database

* **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for incident data

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. React frontend sends requests to Express REST APIs
2. Backend validates and processes incident data
3. MongoDB stores incidents and related information
4. Admin dashboard fetches and displays real-time data
